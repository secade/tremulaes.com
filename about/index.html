        <h2>Meet Me</h2>
        <p>I am, at times, a bit eccentric, but mostly due to my passion for learning everything I possibly can. I moved into the tech field in mid 2013, starting off as a low IT tech at a non-techy company, eventually working my way up to a supervisor in the IT department responsible for training and development of future IT staff, as well as establishing operating standards for technical staff. Now, I'm focusing all energy on becoming a full-fledged Developer.</p>
        <p>Few things in life are as exciting as solving a problem, and the process of development is so often just a series of problems that need to be solved. I hope to be able to join in a field that both rewards talent while purposefully seeking to develop it; I look forward to joining the illustrious ranks of software engineers.</p>
        <h4>Update (5/24/2015)</h4>
        <p>I have accepted a position as a software engineer with a local financial processing company- first steps have been successful!</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adore Ruby and looking for any excuse to use it professionally.</li>
          <li>HTML boilerplate for any web development; growing familiarity with HTML 5.</li>
          <li>Javascript is the soul of the internet; finding more ways to use it along with a framework here and there.</li>
          <li>Excited by the possibilities C# has to offer for game development. Just beginning to learn.</li>
          <li>Daily Ubuntu user, looking for more exposure to server-side Linux experiences.</li>
          <li>Use SASS as my CSCC preprocessor; still getting down the fundamentals of the design mindset.</li>
          <li>Enjoying the power of Jekyll as an HTML preprocessor, and growing more comfortable with it every day.</li>

        <h4>Static Web Development</h4>
        <div class="progress-bar">
          <span class="meter" style="width: 80%"></span>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, I've been exposed to a wide variety of tools and systems for setting up clean, good-looking static sites (such as the one you're on now). Looking for more opportunities to get more practice with handling a variety of different kinds of sites. Typically use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, and JQuery to help with the build.</p>
        <h4>Web Application Development</h4>
        <div class="progress-bar">
          <span class="meter" style="width: 50%"></span>
        </div>
        <p>Very comfortable building small web applications using either Rails or Sinatra frameworks for small-scale deployment to Heroku. Looking forward to any opportunities that allow me to work with larger-scale projects so I can grow my skillset here, especially in terms of optimization knowledge, efficiency, database management, scalability, continuous integration/deployment, and proper testing suites.</p>
        <h4>'Soft Skills'</h4>
        <div class="progress-bar">
          <span class="meter" style="width: 90%"></span>
        </div>
        <p>After years of work across many different industries, locations, cultures and languages, I feel very confident that my ability to communicate is exceptional. I'm comfortable in nearly any environment and have experience with client management, customer retention, educational/teaching curriculum development, as well as many others. I plan to take this skill set and enrich the field of development.</p>
        <p>Regular use of a variety of Agile Methodology applications has helped me gain a basic but strong understanding of project management in development. I am also comfortable with working remotely and in a distributed work environment, happily managing communication through email, chat, PM software such as Trello or Basecamp, or Github issue tracker.</p>

          <li>Game Development
            <p>Love that my new skillset allows me to begin building games myself. Though I've only played with a few smallscale projects, I'm playing around with Monogame and Unity to harness the power of my new developer skills to begin creating real beauty.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Food
            <p>Hard to stop snacking when anything food is around, and love to cook pretty much anything. True kitchen gadget obsession.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Reading
            <p>From Bronte to Herbert, from high fantasy to autobiographical novels, I'll read almost anything so long as time allows. Recently been limited to a whole bunch of tech books- looking forward to returning to true leisure reading.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Writing
            <p>Love to sit down and knock out a blog post here and there, or maybe some poetry/prose when inspiration strikes. Got a real passion for world-building and character creation on an epic scale.</p>
