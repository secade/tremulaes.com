        <h2>Meet Me</h2>
        <p>I am, at times, a bit eccentric, but mostly due to my passion for learning everything I possibly can. I moved into the tech field in mid 2013, starting off as a low IT tech at a non-techy company, eventually working my way up to a supervisor in the IT department responsible for training and development of future IT staff, as well as establishing operating standards for technical staff. Now, I'm focusing all energy on becoming a full-fledged Developer.</p>
        <p>Few things in life are as exciting as solving a problem, and the process of development is so often just a series of problems that need to be solved. I hope to be able to join in a field that both rewards talent while purposefully seeking to develop it; I look forward to joining the illustrious ranks of software engineers.</p>

        <h4>Static Web Development</h4>

          <span class="meter" style="width: 45%"></span>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, I've been exposed to a wide variety of tools and systems for setting up clean, good-looking static sites (such as the one you're on now). Looking for more opportunities to get more practice with handling a variety of different kinds of sites. Typically use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, <a href="http://wercker.com/">Wercker</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon">Bourbon</a> to help with the build.</p>

        <p>After years of work across many different industries, locations, cultures and languages, I feel very confident that my ability to communicate is exceptional. I'm comfortable in nearly any environment and have experience with client management, customer retention, educational/teaching curriculum development, as well as many others. I plan to take this skill set and enrich the field of development.</p>
