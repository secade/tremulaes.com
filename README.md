## Tools

#### Jekyll

I used Jekyll as an html preprocessor to help with creation of the site. This is my first project using this tool.

#### Bourbon/Neat

I preferred the lightweight nature of Bourbon and Neat over the overbearing nature of something as heavy as Bootstrap. This is my first project using either of these tools.

#### Wercker

I used this as a means of automated deployment to my webhosting service.

#### Amazon Webservices

I use a few Amazon products for this site:

1. S3: I use an S3 bucket to host the actual website data (only possible with static sites)
2. Route 53: Used for DNS and routing purposes.
3. Cloudfront: Used to turn my S3 bucket into an actual webhost.
