# Getting Greedy
## Craving all the knowledge that I can get

I'll be the first to admit that I'm a greedy person. If you've never been unfortunate enough to watch me sit down and eat a platter of good chicken wings, it might be hard to understand what I mean- to summarize, I leave behind a small pile of white, hollow sticks. I eat every scrap of skin, meat, tendon and marrow that I can chew off. Because I want it all.

Education is approached in much the same way, whether formal or casual. Just like a good wing, the moment I see an opportunity to learn within my grasp, I grab onto it and do not let it go until I have cleaned it completely. I want every tidbit, every nuance and every miniscule opportunity to further myself- if it's new information, I want it and I want it bad.

I want it downloaded into my brain, experienced and understood, explained thoroughly by experts and novices alike- I can throw in as many grains of salt as necessary, but first I need the data. Any data; all the data. Learning for me has to start from a basic framework that I build with pre-reading and listening, learning the vocabuarly and advanced study. Then I fill in all the details with sandboxing and experiential, kinesthetic learning. 

It's worked well for me thus far, but it never slakes my thirst for more knowledge. Learning to program and chasing my dream to become a developer has been a somewhat frightening experience- the more I learn in tech, the more avenues to continue learning I find. Every article I touch shows me new technologies or toolsets that I crave; every conversation piques my interest and threatens to drag me deep into sleepless rabbit holes.

Oh boy, am I greedy, and how I love it.
