# Graduation
## No really, did I graduate

It goes without saying that my experience in DBC was one of intensity and a great deal of pressure. I walked in with a pretty long list of goals, expectations, and objectives. I wanted to be my best, to crush every challenge, and to walk away victorious and ready to become an amazing developer.

I suspect it'll take a few weeks to finish processing all of what happened during my time at DBC, first and last cohort ever in Columbus. Knowing that I'm walking away feeling conflicted towards DBC only further obfuscates the matter- their reputation is important to me as a person who needs to trade on it to get a job, but I want to be honest at the same time about what happened.

9 weeks was just the right length of time for our experience here in Columbus. I was getting close to burn out, but never quite hit it. I put on weight, and am looking forward to getting more fit and trim again. I miss the discipline of a calmer, more reliable schedule of regular sleep and eating habits. Everything has been put on hold for this.

It's probably a bit of rambling, but I'll excuse it for now. I graduated yesterday afternoon from DBC and my job search is underway. I expect to approach this next step with the same intensity and tenacity of my last effort and to be similarly rewarded. I will never stop working hard and I will not settle for something that isn't right for me.

What is a little scary is that this feeling of ignorance, of not knowing enough, will probably never go away. Development is a terrifyingly complex field and there's so much information. I've got two upcoming personal projects that I'm looking forward to, as well as some additional work on this site, all of which are large stretches into realms of understanding I as of yet know nothing about.

Yesterday, I graduated from Dev Bootcamp. Today, my real education begins.
