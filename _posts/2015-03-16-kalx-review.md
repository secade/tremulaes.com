# KalamazooX
## First Visit to a Tech Conference

It was a last minute choice to attend KalX, and probably not the smartest idea. Fellow student [Jan Dennison](http://jannypie.github.io/) and I laughed pretty much the entire drive up to Michigan at the insanity of attending in the middle of our Dev Bootcamp experience- we had homework, we had prep work, we had reading and stress but mostly a complete lack of sleep. But we went, and it was worth it.

The benefit from conferences is often subtle, especially when the focus isn't to give you a window into a brand new technology or tool. KalX features talks and conversations about soft skills and values that extend across the entire tech community and far away from our desks. Yet even subtle benefits can echo over the course of your career, and I know that my time at KalX will do exactly that.

One talk in particular raised a bit of ire. [Jay Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonharris) shared his views on passion and hardwork, virtues pretty much unquestionably extolled in our society- simply put, he described both as shit (poop emojis abound). Though I found myself growing both frustrated and annoyed at his choice of delivery, I did appreciate a great deal of his message- a reminder that passion alone _isn't_ enough for success, something that can be helpful to keep in mind especially as the dev community (or maybe just the Ruby people) grows more comfortable talking about passion.

A few beers and some really great conversation later, I felt a lot more comfortable in my reaction. Though I disliked his particular choice in delivery, I really did agree with a lot that he had to say. It was simple, and even when antagonistic, often times true. It was interesting- the talk I disliked the most is the one I reacted to the most strongly, and the one that I continued to really ~~hate on~~ discuss with others at the bar.

That isn't to say the talks that I liked and enjoyed and agreed were won't stick- the entire day was filled with great words, ideas and I know It'll take some time to really process it. Even better, I was fortunate enough to get to meet some amazing people both at the events afterwards and then even at the hotel- I was lucky enough to bug a few cool people all the way up until four in the morning, doing my best to pick their brains and extract whatever information I could.

Overall, I call it a success. Special thanks to everyone organizing KalX, my car buddy Jan, and my mentors Alyssa Diaz, Matt Jones, and Chris Vaughn for leading the way, bringing us along, and allowing me to crash the party.
