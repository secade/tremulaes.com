# Forever Dumb
## Blissfully Swimming in Ignorance

Working in tech means something different to all of us, even/especially for those of us in development. Hardware has come a very long way in recent years, but nothing seems to change quite as fast as the world of development. Every day, corporations, startups, online communities and individuals are using the utmost of their resources to help build new and better tools for today and tomorrow.

I'm a huge fan of the Ruby development principle 'Convention over Configuration'. In some heavier circumstances, it can feel overwhelming- like trying to get a large Rails project to bend to my will- but it also helps save me a lot of time. While there is value in understanding how to properly configure an HTTP server, it's pretty damn sweet that Rails allows me to dive in and focus on developing what makes my product *different* from what the world has to offer. 

I can abstract over the boilerplate. A lot of modern tools and systems allow for this, and it's terrific. It's my nature to want to understand all the guts of everything I do- my last video game sample involved me getting as low-level as I could justify. Building a state machine from scratch, constructing my own mini-asset pipeline, and writing my own collision engine- it was *fun*. But what's terrific is that next time, I can go search for tools written by more people that are smarter and more experienced than me that accomplish my goals way better than what I could hope to do in a few days, weeks or even years.

Working in development is like resigining yourself to be stupid for the rest of your professional life. No matter how much of an expert you become on some things, there will always be a kablillion (that's a real number) other things you simply don't have the time or bandwidth to be an expert at. Staying 'up to date' is a hilarious impossibility- at best, I can slowly focus my energies into a few slices of the development realm and get as knowledgeable as possible in those areas. At best.

It's terrific to be new in tech. It's wonderful to go to a meetup or read an article and realize I have no actual knowledge regarding *anythin* these people are talking about. It's terrific to invest time and energy to correct the problem- I always take down notes on a few key points that I wasn't familiar with and then later go read up on it, ask questions to more knowledgeable friends and colleagues, and slowly start to build a context for this new set of information.

Even in just the past month, I've been doing this constantly. Diving into a domain and being faced with an enormous set of difficult problems means that I'm often writing very little actual code, and instead having to *think* about every single I do before I can do it because things are complicated and often muddy. I have to spend time researching tools and methods, I have to do actual due diligence before deciding that building a solution inhouse is the right call- because friendly, it often isn't.

Why reinvent the wheel? It's a common arrogance that leads so many companies and individuals to only trust inhouse products and solutions. In other fields, I almost always felt this way- "No one understands my needs better than me", and "I hate being coupled to inadequate solutions", or "I know what is best". Well, (un)fortunately, in development, I can comfortably say that at this stage of my career, I simply do *not* know what is best. I can't write a decent algorithm for shit, but there's a wonderful 'Internet' out there full of terrific solutions created by terribly smart people. They give me so many of those beautiful solutions for free and save me millions of hours. Good work, Internet.

I'm slowly growing more comfortable with my ignorance. I'm slowly becoming more okay with using other people's solutions, searching for new gems that come as a packaged solution for my problem. I'm no longer ashamed of turning to other people for help- hell, I can't wait to dive into MonoGame and see what tools it comes with that will let me focus on the core gameplay development that I want to do on my next project. I'm loving Rails more than ever, and I am thankful for the terrific open-source communities that have helped support my just-beginning career in development.

It's okay to be ignorant. We are all stupid about a hell of a lot in this realm, and that's okay. We just need to be okay with working together and reaching out to one another to fill in those gaps when we need help. I'm alright with being forever dumb- but hell if I'm not making every effort to go to bed slightly less dumb than I woke up.
