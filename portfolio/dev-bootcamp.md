## Dev Bootcamp

![Dev Bootcamp logo](/img/dev-bootcamp.jpg)

[Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) is a code school that focuses on helping its students to become excellent beginners. Rather than claiming they can produce an amazing, high-level developer in a manner of months, they recognize the need for on-hand experience and instead work to teach a variety of skills that will help its graduates move into junior level positions to begin their careers as Devs.

I'm now finishing up the prep phase of this program and looking forward to moving on to the intensive portion. This site may not be updated too regularly over the next few months because of the program- with an expectation of anywhere from 60 to 100 hours a week of work, it's safe to say that things are going to get pretty intense. I'm very much looking forward to this.
