<h2>Tremulaes.com</h2>

<p>This is the first website I ever built entirely on my own. I used a variety of tools to help put it together:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Jekyll as an HTML preprocessor/local test server</li>
  <li>SASS as a CSS preprocessor</li>
  <li>AWS S3 bucket for web hosting with Cloudfront</li>
  <li>Bourbon as a framework for CSS.</li>
  <li>GIMP for any photo editing/manipulation</li>
  <li>Piskell.com for pixel art</li>
  <li>Paletton.com for colors/schemes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Public repo available <a href="https://github.com/secade/tremulaes.com">here</a>.

<h2>Versions</h2>

<h4>0.1 Alpha?</h4>

<p>Originally hosted at secade.github.io, I made this site within weeks of first learning HTML/CSS. It used SASS but was extremely limited in functionality as well as being full of design flaws. Regularly added blog content but rarely updated any actual code/scripting to the site. The posts themselves lacked a footer and header as well as navigational buttons. Very ugly little guy.</p>

<h4>1.0 First Deploy</h4>

<p>What you see here! Although I followed roughly the same design concept as my original site, I feel like the new site not only is less buggy but also presents a much more professional image overall.</p>
