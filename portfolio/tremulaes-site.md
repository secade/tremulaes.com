## Tremulaes.com

This is the first website I ever built entirely on my own. I used a variety of tools to help put it together:

1. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as an HTML preprocessor/local test server
2. [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor
3. [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) S3 bucket for web hosting with Cloudfront
4. [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) as a framework for CSS
5. [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) for any photo editing/manipulation
6. [Piskelapp.com](http://www.piskelapp.com/) for pixel art
7. [Paletton.com](http://paletton.com/) for colors/schemes

Public repo available [here](https://github.com/secade/tremulaes.com).

## Versions

#### 0.1 Alpha?

Originally hosted at secade.github.io, I made this site within weeks of first learning HTML/CSS. It used SASS but was extremely limited in functionality as well as being full of design flaws. Regularly added blog content but rarely updated any actual code/scripting to the site. The posts themselves lacked a footer and header as well as navigational buttons. Very ugly little guy.

#### 1.0 First Deploy

What you see here! Although I followed roughly the same design concept as my original site, I feel like the new site not only is less buggy but also presents a much more professional image overall.
