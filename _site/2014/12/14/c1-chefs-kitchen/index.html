<h1>We are the Chefs</h1>

<h3>You want it? You make it.</h3>

<p>It isn't easy being a chef. There's an artistry to it, a series of decisions that are made carefully based off of years of experience in the kitchen, a familiarity with their products, and a desire to produce something amazing. Culinary prowress is an art, an expression that few outside of the field can comprehend.</p>

<p>So why should DBC students think of themselves as chefs?</p>

<p>The most important distinction between a standard student and the kind of students that DBC desires is that most students consume, but DBC students are encouraged- even expected- to go into the guts of production and get their hands dirty. DBC wants students that want to actively participate in building their own path to development, not passive consumers who order off a menu and simply eat and eat and eat.</p>

<p>It's important to consider why this is a desire. Building a curriculum that is flexible enough to allow students to take a part in its shaping is much more challenging than handing out cookie-cutter educations. Its much more difficult to bring someone back into the kitchen and teach them your trade in the fire itself rather than simply sitting down and devouring what others produce- but the challenge is more than worthwhile.</p>

<p>Those who learn the fastest are the most motivated. Those who learn the best are those who devote themselves to seeing a problem, idea or technique from as many different angles as possible, and a man that orders from a menu only sees one facet of the meal- final product. How can an untrained food connoissuer hope to ever recreate a beef roulade, or a classic gumbo? There's a technique, an attitude and a culture that can only be learned from spending time not only watching, but causing some damage yourself.</p>

<p>This extends far beyond simply getting hands-on experience with coding- that's a simple given. DBC wants students who get their hands dirty with every aspect of the program, they want culture creators that will shape the future of their own careers by investing deeply into the outcome of the DBC program. It's intended to be interactive at every level, and it's meant for those who want to have a say in their education.</p>

<p>DBC is not for the faint hearted. The expectations are high and the curve is steep, but with the right attitude, everyone can find the path that works best for themselves all while creating an environment that supports and enables their peers.</p>

<p>"Too many chefs will ruin a stew", they say, but DBC isn't worried about that- they want all the chefs they can handle.</p>
