<h2>My Blog</h2>

<p>A collection of thoughts; some random, some required, but at least all mine.</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/03/16/kalx-review/">KalamazooX</a>
      <p>The benefit from conferences is often subtle, especially when the focus isn't to give you a window into a brand new technology or tool. KalX features talks and conversations about soft skills and values that extend across the entire tech community and far away from our desks. Yet even subtle benefits can echo over the course of your career, and I know that my time at KalX will do exactly that.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/03/08/mini-retrospective/">Two Weeks</a>
      <p>I typically study for about 14-16 hours a day, between on-site work with pair programming, mentoring, and group work, followed by solo studies in the evening to do my best to stay ahead of the work and make sure that the mental models I build during the day are both accurate and robust. Learning often involves a lot of rewiring of pathways, ideas, and understanding, and I want to be exposed to as much relevant data as I can.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/02/18/gemfarm_intro/">Gemfarm Preview</a>
      <p>Although I did want to take a big leap forward from the old CLI-based game, I didn't want to destroy my own sanity by doing something really out there/crazy or too technically difficult for me. I thought back to some of the oldest/simplest games I could think of and I remembered my childhood love for Pokemon- the _original_ pokemon, Red and Blue. And I knew it- I wanted a game that looked and felt like an old tile-based, nearly black-and-white game.</p>
    </li>

      <a href="/2015/02/08/t8-tech/">The Garbage Bin</a>
      <p>Computer memory is a somewhat weird concept, and it can be difficult for many modern users to develop a robust understanding since most use is so many levels above direct memory management. This blog post is intended to give an overview of some different kinds of memory that contribute to many modern computer environments, as well as the concept of garbage collection and its importance.</p>
    </li>

      <a href="/2015/02/08/c8-conflict/">Keep It Cool</a>
      <p>I worked overseas for several years in South Korea and got to see a pretty wide variety of work environments while I was there. My first job, though, was oftentimes a total nightmare with a totally disorganized office and a very serious inability to communicate expectations. I learned a lot of really terrible habits, but one incident in particular always sticks out.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/02/05/t7-javascript/">Into a New Land</a>
      <p>Several years ago, I first got the idea to learn web development from a friend and immediately dived into the CodeAcademy courses for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was challenging for me; with no technical background at all and rarely using computers for anything other than video games and music, I had very little framework on which to build my knowledge. I quickly abandoned the thought.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/02/05/c7-values/">My Fuel Cell</a>
      <p>Looking back at some of my most satisfying moments in life, one unquestionably consistent element is discipline. I define this simply as 'Doing the things I don't want to do'.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/27/t6-oops-concepts/">OOPs I did it again</a>
      <p>Disclaimer: I'm aware that my blog title is a Britney Spears reference, and I apologize.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/27/c6-stereotype-threat/">Subtle Damage</a>
      <p>I lived for several years abroad in South Korea, both in the major metropolitan city of Seoul, and in the rural, smaller city of Gwangju. My time there was rife was situations in which I felt stereotype threat because stereotypes were often the only way people knew how to handle the strange, foreign tall blonde guy.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/22/t5-ruby-classes/">Stabby Stabby</a>
      <p>Compared to many other OOP languages, the Ruby commands for creating class specifications, then instantiating the class into 'physical' objects is fairly straightforward and almost english-readable. A class is a general description for the possible 'shape' of an object. Trying to come up with physical, real-world analogies to every aspect of OOP is both difficult and a bit unrealistic, so I'll eschew devoting too much time on that topic and dive straight into an example on knives.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/20/c5-feedback/">The Triple Threat</a>
      <p>I've been working professionally for about 7 years and in pretty varied environments. I've gone overseas and helped build a new business from the ground up, I've gotten to interface with members of the US state department and our nation's ambassador's the world; I've also worked in cafes, libraries, bookstores, tutoring centers, and drugstores. While the differences between the work flows from one job to another can be astounding at times, one of the few consistencies was that no matter what, I was working with other people.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/14/t4-enumerable-methods/">Cartography</a>
      <p>Imagine a factory assembly line. Picture yourself standing on the floor at a particular spot in the process as the machines and people around you work their magic to produce, say, a can of soup. You're standing at the place where the cans, starting off as sheets of metal, are cut, stamped, then twisted into the shape of the infamous Campbell's Soup. Right in front of you, arms of machine's whirl as the metal transforms from a cold, alien sheet to the comfortable image of a can.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/13/c4-tech-issues/">Holes in Our World</a>
      <p>A common conversation in popular culture, especially in academics, has been the overall lack of diversity in STEM fields- this certainly includes the tech sector. Numerous studies and reports continue to show that woman and people of color are sorely underrepresented in the technical fields of computer science and engineering. Although the numbers have been increasing in recent years, the balance still remains sorely out of whack, and the tech community suffers.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/11/t3-arrays-hashes/">Hashercize</a>
      <p>One of the biggest struggles that I’ve had in moving over to Ruby has been trying to grasp the concept of a Hash- what are they for? What is their purpose? How are they used in production? It’s been a real challenge to wrap my mind around why you would ever choose a Hash over an array, so I’ve had to do some considerable reading to better grasp what they do the same, and what they do differently.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/11/c3-thinking-style/">Gimme Dem Brains</a>
      <p>I’ve always considered myself fortunate to have the manner in which I think and learn. According to the Gregorc analysis, I have a Concrete Random thinking style, though from descriptions I believe I stray fairly wildly across the entire spectrum depending on mood and subject matter.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2015/01/04/t2-css-design/">Making Pixel Boxes</a>
      <p>CSS spacing and positioning elements are without a doubt tricky principles. Understanding when to use padding, margin or border to make a site look exactly how you want it to is a challenge even for experienced web developers.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2014/12/14/t1-git-blog/">Version Control via Git</a>
      <p>Version control has dramatically changed the way that people are able to collaborate with one another.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <a href="/2014/12/14/c1-chefs-kitchen/">We are the Chefs</a>
      <p>It isn't easy being a chef. There's an artistry to it, a series of decisions that are made carefully based off of years of experience in the kitchen, a familiarity with their products, and a desire to produce something amazing. Culinary prowress is an art, an expression that few outside of the field can comprehend.</p>
