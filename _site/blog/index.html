<p>A collection of thoughts; some random, some required, but at least all mine.</p>

      <p>I've always had an issue with intensity. I think of myself as an energizer bunny- I like running at full speed, all the time, forever. Time off, time away from productivity is an unhelpful waste and an unacceptable choice to me. An afternoon without some sort of gain is an afternoon stuffed deep into the trash heap. It's an embarassment.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/06/28/learning-algorithms/">Learning Algorithms</a> (Sunday, June 28, 2015)</p>
      <p>Each Thursday morning for the past several weeks, I've had the pleasure of joining a few experienced developers in a small social gathering called Code and Coffee (Cbus version!). It's at a cafe right up the street from my office, so it's easy to just head out a few hours early to spend time with developers from around the city. Even if it does end up more 'coffee' than 'code', it's still a good chance to expand my circle a bit and interface with others who care about tech.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/06/21/sunday-study/">Sunday Studies</a> (Sunday, June 21, 2015)</p>
      <p>Last August, I met some friends for dimsum late one Sunday morning while we were all hungover from our respective Saturday nights out. After racking up a substantial bill from devouring large amounts of terrific Chinese food, we stumbled on over to a cafe I like to chat and hang out. At the time, I'd slowly been studying to take the CompTia A+ exam (was still working in Ops), and thought it would be fun to study with others around.</p>

      <p>Working in tech means something different to all of us, even/especially for those of us in development. Hardware has come a very long way in recent years, but nothing seems to change quite as fast as the world of development. Every day, corporations, startups, online communities and individuals are using the utmost of their resources to help build new and better tools for today and tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Every minute of that work was exciting to me! Before I started with IT, I (apparently) knew surprisingly little about computers for someone who had been using them pretty much his whole life. Having the opportunity to learn about individual machine architecture and slowly moving up into systems design and trying to grasp how the web worked was a very stimulating challenge and I only wanted more. Eventually, I also developed a fascination with development and got into that, but my love for the hardware side of things hasn't gone away.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/06/04/static-site-tutorial/">Static Site Setup Tutorial</a> (Thursday, June 04, 2015)</p>
      <p>I love static websites. They're served very fast and security is practically not even a concern- no database to hack, no data to mine, nothing to pull or inject or mess with at all. This site was my first attempt at building a static site from nearly scratch, picking technologies that I barely understood and somehow stringing them together without really having much of a clue at all as to how anything worked.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/05/31/learning-perl/">Learning Perl</a> (Sunday, May 31, 2015)</p>
      <p>Ruby has spoiled me.
Dynamically typed, variable syntax, everything-is-an-object, learning Ruby was a joy and the challenges of my time as a Ruby initiate were most often CS struggles rather than fighting with the language itself. Even just a few weeks into the language meant that I could sit down and spin out terrible code that did some pretty cool things, like with my project [Gemfarm](/portfolio/gemfarm/). Ruby does so much for you and abstracts over so many things that I never had to really understand what was happening underneath.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/05/25/job-search/">The Hunt For Great Employment</a> (Monday, May 25, 2015)</p>
      <p>On April 24, I graduated from Dev Bootcamp and was thrust out into the world as an employable freshman in the development industry. After the appropriate amount of celebratory hedonism, it hit me the following night when I woke up- I was *actually* unemployed. I *actually* had to get a job. In a field where I was a total n00b with no degree, no pedigree, and little more than the dogtags that came with graduation from DBC.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="/2015/04/24/graduation/">Graduation</a> (Friday, April 24, 2015)</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that my experience in DBC was one of intensity and a great deal of pressure. I walked in with a pretty long list of goals, expectations, and objectives. I wanted to be my best, to crush every challenge, and to walk away victorious and ready to become an amazing developer.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/04/08/getting-greedy/">Getting Greedy</a> (Wednesday, April 08, 2015)</p>
      <p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a greedy person. If you've never been unfortunate enough to watch me sit down and eat a platter of good chicken wings, it might be hard to understand what I mean- to summarize, I leave behind a small pile of white, hollow sticks. I eat every scrap of skin, meat, tendon and marrow that I can chew off. Because I want it all.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/03/29/work-life-balance/">Work-Life Balance?</a> (Sunday, March 29, 2015)</p>
      <p>All that said, the challenge and workload here in Dev Bootcamp is such that it could overwhelm even my voracious appetite for knowledge and near-masochistic desire to learn everything and do every assignment. I like lists and checkboxes, but the work has surpassed what I can do- even the Energizer Bunny has to recharge sometimes.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/03/16/kalx-review/">KalamazooX</a> (Monday, March 16, 2015)</p>
      <p>The benefit from conferences is often subtle, especially when the focus isn't to give you a window into a brand new technology or tool. KalX features talks and conversations about soft skills and values that extend across the entire tech community and far away from our desks. Yet even subtle benefits can echo over the course of your career, and I know that my time at KalX will do exactly that.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/03/08/mini-retrospective/">Two Weeks</a> (Sunday, March 08, 2015)</p>
      <p>I typically study for about 14-16 hours a day, between on-site work with pair programming, mentoring, and group work, followed by solo studies in the evening to do my best to stay ahead of the work and make sure that the mental models I build during the day are both accurate and robust. Learning often involves a lot of rewiring of pathways, ideas, and understanding, and I want to be exposed to as much relevant data as I can.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/02/18/gemfarm_intro/">Gemfarm Preview</a> (Wednesday, February 18, 2015)</p>
      <p>Although I did want to take a big leap forward from the old CLI-based game, I didn't want to destroy my own sanity by doing something really out there/crazy or too technically difficult for me. I thought back to some of the oldest/simplest games I could think of and I remembered my childhood love for Pokemon- the _original_ pokemon, Red and Blue. And I knew it- I wanted a game that looked and felt like an old tile-based, nearly black-and-white game.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/02/08/t8-tech/">The Garbage Bin</a> (Sunday, February 08, 2015)</p>
      <p>Computer memory is a somewhat weird concept, and it can be difficult for many modern users to develop a robust understanding since most use is so many levels above direct memory management. This blog post is intended to give an overview of some different kinds of memory that contribute to many modern computer environments, as well as the concept of garbage collection and its importance.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/02/08/c8-conflict/">Keep It Cool</a> (Sunday, February 08, 2015)</p>
      <p>I worked overseas for several years in South Korea and got to see a pretty wide variety of work environments while I was there. My first job, though, was oftentimes a total nightmare with a totally disorganized office and a very serious inability to communicate expectations. I learned a lot of really terrible habits, but one incident in particular always sticks out.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/02/05/t7-javascript/">Into a New Land</a> (Thursday, February 05, 2015)</p>
      <p>Several years ago, I first got the idea to learn web development from a friend and immediately dived into the CodeAcademy courses for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was challenging for me; with no technical background at all and rarely using computers for anything other than video games and music, I had very little framework on which to build my knowledge. I quickly abandoned the thought.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/02/05/c7-values/">My Fuel Cell</a> (Thursday, February 05, 2015)</p>
      <p>Looking back at some of my most satisfying moments in life, one unquestionably consistent element is discipline. I define this simply as 'Doing the things I don't want to do'.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/27/c6-stereotype-threat/">Subtle Damage</a> (Tuesday, January 27, 2015)</p>
      <p>I lived for several years abroad in South Korea, both in the major metropolitan city of Seoul, and in the rural, smaller city of Gwangju. My time there was rife was situations in which I felt stereotype threat because stereotypes were often the only way people knew how to handle the strange, foreign tall blonde guy.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/22/t5-ruby-classes/">Stabby Stabby</a> (Thursday, January 22, 2015)</p>
      <p>Compared to many other OOP languages, the Ruby commands for creating class specifications, then instantiating the class into 'physical' objects is fairly straightforward and almost english-readable. A class is a general description for the possible 'shape' of an object. Trying to come up with physical, real-world analogies to every aspect of OOP is both difficult and a bit unrealistic, so I'll eschew devoting too much time on that topic and dive straight into an example on knives.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/20/c5-feedback/">The Triple Threat</a> (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)</p>
      <p>I've been working professionally for about 7 years and in pretty varied environments. I've gone overseas and helped build a new business from the ground up, I've gotten to interface with members of the US state department and our nation's ambassador's the world; I've also worked in cafes, libraries, bookstores, tutoring centers, and drugstores. While the differences between the work flows from one job to another can be astounding at times, one of the few consistencies was that no matter what, I was working with other people.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/14/t4-enumerable-methods/">Cartography</a> (Wednesday, January 14, 2015)</p>
      <p>Imagine a factory assembly line. Picture yourself standing on the floor at a particular spot in the process as the machines and people around you work their magic to produce, say, a can of soup. You're standing at the place where the cans, starting off as sheets of metal, are cut, stamped, then twisted into the shape of the infamous Campbell's Soup. Right in front of you, arms of machine's whirl as the metal transforms from a cold, alien sheet to the comfortable image of a can.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/13/c4-tech-issues/">Holes in Our World</a> (Tuesday, January 13, 2015)</p>
      <p>A common conversation in popular culture, especially in academics, has been the overall lack of diversity in STEM fields- this certainly includes the tech sector. Numerous studies and reports continue to show that woman and people of color are sorely underrepresented in the technical fields of computer science and engineering. Although the numbers have been increasing in recent years, the balance still remains sorely out of whack, and the tech community suffers.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/11/t3-arrays-hashes/">Hashercize</a> (Sunday, January 11, 2015)</p>
      <p>One of the biggest struggles that I’ve had in moving over to Ruby has been trying to grasp the concept of a Hash- what are they for? What is their purpose? How are they used in production? It’s been a real challenge to wrap my mind around why you would ever choose a Hash over an array, so I’ve had to do some considerable reading to better grasp what they do the same, and what they do differently.</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><a href="/2015/01/11/c3-thinking-style/">Gimme Dem Brains</a> (Sunday, January 11, 2015)</p>
      <p>I’ve always considered myself fortunate to have the manner in which I think and learn. According to the Gregorc analysis, I have a Concrete Random thinking style, though from descriptions I believe I stray fairly wildly across the entire spectrum depending on mood and subject matter.</p>

      <p><a href="/2015/01/04/t2-css-design/">Making Pixel Boxes</a> (Sunday, January 04, 2015)</p>
      <p>CSS spacing and positioning elements are without a doubt tricky principles. Understanding when to use padding, margin or border to make a site look exactly how you want it to is a challenge even for experienced web developers.</p>

      <p>It isn't easy being a chef. There's an artistry to it, a series of decisions that are made carefully based off of years of experience in the kitchen, a familiarity with their products, and a desire to produce something amazing. Culinary prowress is an art, an expression that few outside of the field can comprehend.</p>
