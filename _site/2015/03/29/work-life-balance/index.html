<h1>Work-Life Balance?</h1>

<h2>Learning to avoid the Burn</h2>

<p>I'm a pretty intense person about most things, but especially when I feel like my future is at stake. As a student in an immersive, intensive development bootcamp, I have a tendency to be really serious in my approach to the studies and work.</p>

<p>All that said, the challenge and workload here in Dev Bootcamp is such that it could overwhelm even my voracious appetite for knowledge and near-masochistic desire to learn everything and do every assignment. I like lists and checkboxes, but the work has surpassed what I can do- even the Energizer Bunny has to recharge sometimes.</p>

<p>As the program has progressed, I've had to spend more and more time on 'self-care'; it's reached a point to where a few other students and I will joke about getting away with anything and justifying it with 'self-care'.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Why did you crash your car through that wall?"</li>
<li>"Self-care."</li>
</ul>


<p>It's been surprising that I'd need to learn how to disengage. I love working myself to the bone and getting shit done, and the satisfaction of completing a difficult challenge- or simply <em>all</em> of the challenges- is something I really crave. I just can't do it anymore- I've had to take a step back and remind myself that DBC isn't about completing a project or two, but about acquiring the skills necessary to become a teachable, functional teammate and junior developer.</p>

<p>In that effort, I've started setting clearer expectations with teammates and partners about hard quits and regular breaks. I dedicate time every day to resting and stepping away from the work, and sometimes even an entire night where I can just recharge with some relaxed gaming, sandboxing a new technology, or having drinks with some friends away from school.</p>

<p>I often still struggle internally with justifying how I can 'waste' so much time on non-school things when I should be so completely devoted to my education, but since I've started making a point of setting aside these times, I've seen an almost immediate turn around- reduced feeling of stress, almost no anxiety, and more comfort/confidence in my interactions with the other students.</p>

<p>Basically, these efforts in self-care have helped me to strike a balance between work and the rest of my life, and therefore enjoy both a great deal more. School no longer stresses me out and I'm enjoying the insanity more and more every day, all the while fulfilling my social needs and spending time with my support system. I'm really happy that I've been able to find this balance, and am excited about using its benefits to carry me through the final four weeks of this program.</p>

<p>Final four weeks? It's almost frightening how little time I have left.</p>
