<h1>Two Weeks</h1>

<h2>My My, Time Flies</h2>

<p>It's really surprising to me that two weeks have already passed since my time in Phase1 of Dev Bootcamp started. It's weird to think that I've been unemployed for however long, and that I've been living the student life again.It's a weird place to be.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for it, and the opportunities that this short time in bootcamp will provide. I want nothing short of great success, so I invest every bit of energy and concern that I can. Nothing less than working my ass to the bone is worthwhile here, and I won't give it anything less than what I've got.</p>

<p>I typically study for about 14-16 hours a day, between on-site work with pair programming, mentoring, and group work, followed by solo studies in the evening to do my best to stay ahead of the work and make sure that the mental models I build during the day are both accurate and robust. Learning often involves a lot of rewiring of pathways, ideas, and understanding, and I want to be exposed to as much relevant data as I can.</p>

<p>One thing I'd forgotten about was the physical exhaustion that comes with learning. Obviously this is the oldest that I've ever been, but the last time that I was really fully devoted to studying I was 21 and I definitely had a lot more energy back then. It's still surprising to me that studying and running through the day's projects can leave me so drained and ready for bed- I could definitely use more sleep on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Overall, DBC is meeting expectations. I'm learning a lot and am often very challenged intellectually. Sometimes the soft-skills portion of the program's expectations get to me a lot more than the curriculum itself- pair programming is new to me and I still am not sure how I feel about it as a whole. I've always enjoyed working alone, and being able to fully work at my own pace is a treat that I suddenly miss. As more of the development world moves towards incorporating pair programming, it'll be very useful to have at least some experience with it, and so I'll take that challenge head on as well.</p>

<p>It's only been two weeks, but I already feel like I've been in this program for months. It's a new Hotel California, and even if graduation is just seven weeks ago, it feels fuzzy, out of reach. All that's left to do for now is just try and find every success that I can while I have the opportunity and access to this education.</p>

<p>Excelsissime, sic itur ad astra. Upward to the highest degree, thus do we reach the stars.</p>
