<h1>Hermitage</h1>

<h2>Learning to take it easy</h2>

<p>I've always had an issue with intensity. I think of myself as an energizer bunny- I like running at full speed, all the time, forever. Time off, time away from productivity is an unhelpful waste and an unacceptable choice to me. An afternoon without some sort of gain is an afternoon stuffed deep into the trash heap. It's an embarassment.</p>

<p>This attitude has always made recovery hard for me. Self-care is a phrase I've used on this blog here and there, often times half joking and rarely in any serious because it's difficult for me to take it seriously in any real way. What does the energizer bunny know about self-care? It's a freaking machine, running on endless batteries, and is expected to just keep going, and going, and going...</p>

<p>But that's not how people work, and is certainly not how I work. It turns out that I <em>do</em> need some time off and away, some time to recover, some space and some dedicated effort to taking things slow. It turns out that i'm not an endlessly powered machine, unforgivingly capable of running until the end of time. It turns out that I am human.</p>

<p>This isn't my first time coming to this revelation, but it does always come as a shock. After the exhausting months in code school and the job search, after my previous job that sucked out my soul while I ran myself into the ground working 60-80 hours a week at an underpaying job that I hated, all while trying to study and figure out how to effect the career change that I knew would change my life, which was immediately following my move back to the US after my time in Asia.</p>

<p>I guess I've been pushing for a while, for a few years now. And I think now that I've seen some very real returns on those years of investment, a part of my brain or perhaps my body said "Time to recover."</p>

<p>It feels more like a hibernation- barely wanting to touch a computer after work, trying to actually stop thinking of everything in terms of the code and logical processes running behind them. I've been binge-watching old television shows, playing World of Warcraft (no shame), and even avoiding the very same-meetups and community that I not so long ago couldn't get enough out of.</p>

<p>The Hermitage is real, and it is powerful. I feel it abetting, and I rejoice. I will take things slowly at first, but soon, I'll be back to the energizer bunny, running headlong and headfirst into my next set of goals, ambitions and dreams. Soon, I'll be running at full speed again, excitedly spouting off about anything and everything tech.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, the Hermitage is chief. It is king. It is... relaxing.</p>
