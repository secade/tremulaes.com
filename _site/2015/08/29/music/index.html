<h1>Music</h1>

<h2>Stuff I listen to while I code</h2>

<p>It hasn't been a particularly technical month for me, I suppose. Work is chugging along swimmingly and I'm still just trying to get myself back into a properly disciplined routine. I haven't been working on anything terribly exciting, though I've finally sat down and started comparing MonoGame and Unity3d, two game dev frameworks I'm investigating for a potential project (taking <a href="http://tremulaes.com/portfolio/blackmetal-demo/">Blackmetal</a> to the next level).</p>

<p>Within Temptation has some older stuff tends to be a lot more 'metal', newer stuff a little more rock and pop friendly. Amazing voice on the singer, they've got at least a few great songs on almost every album. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35RqzSR5Who">Stairway to the Skies</a> is super epic whereas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awvqIi427_A">And We Run</a> is more rocky, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts">Paradise</a> is a duet with the original singer from Nightwish, another terrific metal group. Nightwish has more varied stuff, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tFFz44zvc">The Islander</a> which is more folksy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIBdpFJyFkc">Nemo</a> which is fairly epic, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPonioDYnoY">Elan</a> which is calmer and from their newest album with a new singer.</p>

<p>Kamelot is more recently discovered and is the only metal band with a male singer that I really like. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lecZ8UnsjLs">The Haunting</a> is a an old duet (2005 I think) with the female lead singer from Epica and is just terrific. The music video for Haunting is laughably terrible. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoTvg0t52c">Storm the Sorrow</a> by Epica is pretty cool too, and much more recent. Much better video.</p>

<p>Blackmill is more atmospheric, almost background music but it's super beautiful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDI6HTR9arA">Let it Be</a> almost gives me chills, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeaGUfZM5hs">Spirit of Life</a> is really cool too. They've got a lot of albums and all of their stuff is great for throwing on and getting to work on anything creative. Lost Years is also really good background stuff and is considered vapor wave, very 80s music-esque. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGttQ4Gx_R0">Black Waves</a> is a good sample by them, but the whole album is great for listening to while working.</p>

<p>A little more dynamic but similar to vaporwave would be Dance with the Dead- a little heavier and with some really cool guitar riffs on top of the background stuff. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Egf1OZ1CuE">Invader</a> is pretty intense and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3lpoGABH6A">Andromeda</a> is almost like club music, but that entire album is terrific.</p>

<p>Recently I've gotten into St Vincent, a terrific musician from Texas. Her music is really thoughtful and well-constructed, lyrics and music videos included. I'd start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itt0rALeHE8">Cruel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEY9GJAm8bA">Cheerleader</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9prpAv6kvo">Marrow</a>. In a similar alternative vein, Eisley has been a very long time love of mine. At their last concert, I loudly screamed for them to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpbIPyeG-r0">Mr Moon</a>, but I also really like their softer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIyXJRfIPqA">Combinations</a> and older <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQF5a8dKzGY">Plenty of Paper</a>.</p>

<p>Angela Aki is a japanese singer who does a lot of english songs as well; most songs are her singing and jamming on a piano. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZnUrq-En0A">Santa Fe</a> is one of the first I ever heard, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c60bWoJkCw">Your Love Song</a> is very soft and melancholy, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7bI8TN7ECQ">Tegami</a> is probably her most well known song.</p>

<p>Taking a turn for the weird is an old favorite from college, Aural Vampire. Darkwave, lots of synth and some very weird imagery, their songs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQbAzXHyOfk">Cannibal Coast</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elLNQVhDOpI">Mailer Demon</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk8T87jdQ5Q">Kerguelen Vortex</a> are my favorites, though I have pretty much their whole discography and listen to it regularly.</p>

<p>Purity Ring, an indie group from Canada, has some great stuff that can be fairly weird too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqw4wo8vdY8">Fineshrines</a> has become my favorite by them, but my first love was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVcOwVD4V30">Belispeak</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCCOnKSZ1bY">Grandloves</a> is really relaxing.</p>

<p>Well, that's about it for now. Hopefully, if you've listened to any of these, you've at least enjoyed something!</p>
