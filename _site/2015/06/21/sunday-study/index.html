<h1>Sunday Study</h1>

<h2>A Slice of Discipline</h2>

<p>Last August, I met some friends for dimsum late one Sunday morning while we were all hungover from our respective Saturday nights out. After racking up a substantial bill from devouring large amounts of terrific Chinese food, we stumbled on over to a cafe I like to chat and hang out. At the time, I'd slowly been studying to take the CompTia A+ exam (was still working in Ops), and thought it would be fun to study with others around.</p>

<p>The afternoon took a weird turn when a buddy started talking about his job in IT consulting. I was fascinated- I honestly had had no idea that he was a developer or what it was like to write software as a career. Enamored, I grilled him for pretty much hours and knew then and there that it was what I wanted. I'd seen development things before, dabbled in HTML and JS but never really pursued it much- laziness, lack of motivation, and lack of a good learning process all worked against my efforts to learn alone.</p>

<p>But we talked for hours that day about it, and I found my motivation. He helped me believe that success was actually within my grasp, that I could actually build a future career for myself with the right combination of hard work, networking, and discipline. I believed, and I wanted to make it happen for real.</p>

<p>After experiencing a very effective Sunday, I decided that from then on, Sundays would be dedicated to professional development. Nearly every Sunday since that August, I come back to the same cafe and spend the afternoon reading, writing, blogging and studying, working through code katas or trying to solve algorithmic issues with my burgeoning code skill set. Each week I do different things- might work on prettifying my blog a bit, or tackle some syntax in a new language, or even work on adding new features to a video game project.</p>

<p>What matters most is that I simply am doing it. Doing anything. Being present. It's become such an ingrained habit that all my friends know where I'll be and that they're welcome to join me. I don't even need to put it on the calendar anymore- it's just what I do on Sunday afternoons. Sometimes I'll only be here for a few hours, or maybe all day, depending on how I feel and what else is going on.</p>

<p>Sundays are a day to study, to work, to cowork and to share. To develop myself professionally. I encourage all of you to build a similar habit in your life- a dedicated time each week to growth in some area that you want to see improvement. For me, that means code, or tech or computer science in some form. For others, it's been studying Japanese or reading on design theories, art history or cool builds in WoW. It's become a little community event among my friends, and I'm so happy to both have this little slice of discipline and also the opportunity to share it with the people in my life.</p>

<p>If you're in Columbus, join me some week and lets improve ourselves, just a little bit, this Sunday.</p>
