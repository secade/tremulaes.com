<h1>Learning Algorithms</h1>

<h2>Trying to build my own well-rounded education</h2>

<p>Each Thursday morning for the past several weeks, I've had the pleasure of joining a few experienced developers in a small social gathering called Code and Coffee (Cbus version!). It's at a cafe right up the street from my office, so it's easy to just head out a few hours early to spend time with developers from around the city. Even if it does end up more 'coffee' than 'code', it's still a good chance to expand my circle a bit and interface with others who care about tech.</p>

<p>This past week, one of the gents mentioned that he is taking a class on <a href="https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-008">Coursera for algorithms</a>, and I immediately jumped at the opportunity to do the same. I've always liked the idea of them, and especially lacking any formal CS education, I know that getting, at the very least, familiar with some of the basic principles would do well for my career. I signed up right away, excited to be moving forward.</p>

<p>The class utilizes Java and an automated grading protocol which means that I have quite a bit of overhead to even get to the point where I can read or understand what's going on. The second week's materials just opened up but I'm naturally behind, having forgotten about the class over the course of the week's social and professional activities. I spent some time last night getting a comfortable Java environment set up and running, playing a bit with the language and doing a kata or two in Java since I'm pretty unfamiliar with it.</p>

<p>It's felt like a hectic two months since I graduated from DBC- holy crap, two months forreal. I've dabbled in a lot of things, meandering from topic to topic and never really diving too heavy into anything. I've played with Perl, C++, C# and Rust, Mono frameworks and new text editors, a ton of reading on business, startups and financing tech; there's so much to know, so much to play with, so much <em>knowledge</em> out there that I could never sleep again and drive myself blind trying to read it all up.</p>

<p>Now seems like a good time to slow the breadth search and start diving in a little further into something. Coursera can be terrific and provides just enough structure to really encourage me to push and find some comfort in knowing there are others with me. Hopefully I'll find more classmates to work through the material, but it isn't necessary- I'm looking forward to the struggle of taking this new topic and enriching my experience as a novice developer.</p>

<p>Ever upwards, as they say. Why don't you join me?</p>
