<h1>The Hunt For Great Employment</h1>

<h2>Searching for work as a freshman developer</h2>

<p>On April 24, I graduated from Dev Bootcamp and was thrust out into the world as an employable freshman in the development industry. After the appropriate amount of celebratory hedonism, it hit me the following night when I woke up- I was <em>actually</em> unemployed. I <em>actually</em> had to get a job. In a field where I was a total n00b with no degree, no pedigree, and little more than the dogtags that came with graduation from DBC.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong- Dev Bootcamp was the right choice for me. I'm fortunate to have had the opportunity to participate in the Columbus Localhost pilot, and I really did learn a ton. But when compared with other the other routes to becoming a developer- working your way up for years from IT, or getting an engineering degree- the lack of something more <em>substantial</em> was suddenly reminiscent of trying to cross the ocean on a raft made of flotsam.</p>

<p>Initial fears aside, I was excited. I'd had my eyes on that exact moment for a long time- the minute I signed up for DBC, I made "getting a job doing development" my first and biggest long-term goal. Hell, it started even before that, back a year ago when I got my first taste with playing with JavaScript at my old company. I knew it was for me, I knew I wanted it, and I put all my energy into making that happen.</p>

<p>And so the job search began. DBC offers an optional, short career week to graduates to help them kick off their job search with setting up resumes, LinkedIn profiles, networking, and learning how to identify and articulate what your priorities are. What are you passionate about? What do you want to be doing? What matters most?</p>

<h4>Priorities</h4>

<p>For me, it boiled down to a few key points:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want full-time, salaried employment as a developer.</li>
<li>I want to either stay in Columbus, work remotely, or relocate to Chicago or the Pacific Northwest.</li>
<li>I want an environment that allows me to work on different projects/problems over time without getting pigeon-holed too early in my career.</li>
<li>I want a work environment that encourages learning without hand-holding or coddling.</li>
<li>I did not want to work in an environment with 100% pairing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Beyond those four points, everything else is flexible. I don't give a damn about the language or stack that I'm working with, nor do I care about the size of the company. I don't want or need a fully robust apprenticeship, preferring instead a more trial-by-fire approach of getting thrown into work with experienced professionals.</p>

<p>I'm okay with being the weakest link at the beginning. I'm okay with being the one who asks questions, who studies outside of work to become a better developer. I am okay with struggling and want an environment that understands failure is a big part of development, and that encourages me to be a better dev so I can, over time, grow to be a big contributer to the work and codebase.</p>

<h4>The Hunt</h4>

<p>Once I identified my priorities, everything else was a breeze. I applied to pretty much every company I came into contact with, setting up interviews and info sessions, just trying to have as many discussions as I possibly could manage without dying. I ended up interviewing every day for almost 2 weeks, and as exhausting as it was, I enjoyed it <em>so much</em>. It turns out that I really do just love talking about technology with people, and every conversation was further affirmation that this path was the right one for me.</p>

<h4>The End</h4>

<p>Thankfully, the process was short. After my first round of interviews, I followed up with a few companies, received offers, and am happy to declare the hunt complete. I will be starting work with 2Checkout in Columbus tomorrow and I couldn't be more excited. Not only is it a fantastic environment, but I didn't have to compromise on any of my priorities and was able meet a lot of my 'wants' as well.</p>

<p>I want to thank my DBC Teachers, specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/alycit">Alyssa Diaz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_ltw">Lucas Willet</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbaker">Matt Baker</a> for pushing me hard and giving me an environment that I could excel in, as well as my Cbus DBC cohort. I want to thank my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/mogsam55">Sam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chintrademark">Kelun</a> for supporting me throughout the program. I'd also like to thank my mentors and the Columbus community, <a href="https://twitter.com/mistercvaughn">Chris Vaughn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/al2o3cr">Matt Jones</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gayleforce">Gayle Bender</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdarby">Matt Darby</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wtfluckey">Aly Fluckey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lia_James">Lia James</a> and so many more. Thank you all so much.</p>

<p>It's going to be terrific. Let's crush it.</p>
