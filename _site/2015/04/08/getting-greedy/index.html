<h1>Getting Greedy</h1>

<h2>Craving all the knowledge that I can get</h2>

<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a greedy person. If you've never been unfortunate enough to watch me sit down and eat a platter of good chicken wings, it might be hard to understand what I mean- to summarize, I leave behind a small pile of white, hollow sticks. I eat every scrap of skin, meat, tendon and marrow that I can chew off. Because I want it all.</p>

<p>Education is approached in much the same way, whether formal or casual. Just like a good wing, the moment I see an opportunity to learn within my grasp, I grab onto it and do not let it go until I have cleaned it completely. I want every tidbit, every nuance and every miniscule opportunity to further myself- if it's new information, I want it and I want it bad.</p>

<p>I want it downloaded into my brain, experienced and understood, explained thoroughly by experts and novices alike- I can throw in as many grains of salt as necessary, but first I need the data. Any data; all the data. Learning for me has to start from a basic framework that I build with pre-reading and listening, learning the vocabuarly and advanced study. Then I fill in all the details with sandboxing and experiential, kinesthetic learning.</p>

<p>It's worked well for me thus far, but it never slakes my thirst for more knowledge. Learning to program and chasing my dream to become a developer has been a somewhat frightening experience- the more I learn in tech, the more avenues to continue learning I find. Every article I touch shows me new technologies or toolsets that I crave; every conversation piques my interest and threatens to drag me deep into sleepless rabbit holes.</p>

<p>Oh boy, am I greedy, and how I love it.</p>
