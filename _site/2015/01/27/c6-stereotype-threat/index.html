<h1>Subtle Damage</h1>

<h3>The continued and flourishing damage of stereotypes</h3>

<p>I lived for several years abroad in South Korea, both in the major metropolitan city of Seoul, and in the rural, smaller city of Gwangju. My time there was rife was situations in which I felt stereotype threat because stereotypes were often the only way people knew how to handle the strange, foreign tall blonde guy.</p>

<p>Simply navigating life was difficult, but it was made all the harder by some of the daily doses of stereotypes I'd hear: "Americans aren't any good at learning Korean", "foreigners can't understanding anything about Korea", "white people do X or Y". It was a daily task to hear these things, especially in the smaller city, and I'd rarely ever felt so judged and put upon as there before.</p>

<p>Although I didn't have the same performance-based tasks benching on some of the stereotypes thrown around, I remember the discouragement that I use to feel everyday when I'd simply be trying to get through my day-to-day and have to be reminded how different I was and all the baggage that came along with it. Being foreign, being different, being a non-native speaker of Korean- all set me apart, all gave me anxiety when I'd do something as simple as visit a bank to handle a mundane task.</p>

<p>My experience with stereotype threat goes beyond simply race. As a white male, I have implicit access to a lot of privilege here in the US; my time abroad helped to really highlight that reality when, suddenly, a lot of that privilege was suddenly taken away or morphed beyond recognition. As a gay man, it went beyond just cultural transition as I began to grow more comfortable in my own skin and 'come out', as the very goes.</p>

<p>In the past year, as I've prepared myself for a new career in the tech world, I've seen and heard many conversations about diversity and the lack of it in our industry. It goes beyond race- it extends to economic classes and sexual orientation/identity. I've heard many personal anecdotes from gay men and women who feel treated differently due to their identity or orientation, and I've felt it from time to time as well.</p>

<p>In the old boys club, gay men are often an anomaly- not women, but not quite men, either. I've heard homosexuals laughingly referred to as a third gender, or women, or 'whatever' on many occasions which is confusing to me- I'm fairly certain we're all people, and I don't see why being a woman should be taken as an insult. Suddenly, it's a lot harder to feel comfortable in my own skin.</p>

<p>Stereotype threat comes into play when I'm reminded, time and time again, of the common perception of homosexuals as life-long partiers, never serious and only interested in the moment's fun. In modern discussions throughout the political world, damaging stereotypes are flung around as defense against gay marriage or arguing for continued legal basis to discriminate against gays. When I think of myself as a member of the tech industry and I heard recruiters, engineers, potential superiors or coworkers subscribing to any of the many stereotypes towards homosexuals, it's inevitable that I immediately begin to question whether or not they subscribe to them all.</p>

<p>And then the maelstrom of self-doubt turns on full-force: Does this person legitimately dislike gay people? Do they think I'm some air-head who's better off as a flight attendant instead of a developer? Am I wrong to be taking my career seriously? Can I succeed in an industry so based off of skills that I don't have? What am I doing here?</p>

<p>It happens again, and again and again and again. Among many gamers, gay remains a perfectly valid insult to throw around, and I've heard that used casually among friends at conferences or seminars- but that turns on the threat, the anxiety, the self-doubt and the questioning.</p>

<p>With the maelstrom so ever-present, I can't help but believe that I'm underperforming. I work hard and I wish that the threat wasn't so real, but in the tech industry, it's hard to feel like I've ever belonged when there are people who still refer to me as a third gender. All of these things can lead to myself or others feeling unhappy or stressed about their ability to perform and subsequently then underperform.</p>

<p>TLDR: Watch your language, your attitudes, and take your phillistine opinions elsewhere. You're only serving to deny the community the opportunity to benefit from everyone's best effort, and in tech more so than any other world, meritocracy should be king.</p>
