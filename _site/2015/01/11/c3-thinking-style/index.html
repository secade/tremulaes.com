<h1>Gimme Dem Brains</h1>

<h3>Why I Think my Brains are Delicious</h3>

<p>I’ve always considered myself fortunate to have the manner in which I think and learn. According to the Gregorc analysis, I have a Concrete Random thinking style, though from descriptions I believe I stray fairly wildly across the entire spectrum depending on mood and subject matter. Most importantly, I believe it is my curiosity and desire to know more that fuels my brain and my student-style, and I know that those things are going to come in handy throughout DBC.</p>

<p>My thought style is a strange combination of methodical and seeming randomness as I work through issues in my own order. I often prefer to build a solid foundation of knowledge before moving into higher levels of material- I like to pre-read and familiarize myself with vocabulary and concepts, even if I don’t understand them yet. I expend a great deal of energy in covering a lot of territory at first so that when I go back in, in round 2 or 3 or 4, I know exactly where to plug in the new knowledge that I acquire. It’s a method that I’ve used over the years to learn a pretty wide set of topics.</p>

<p>Although Ruby is new for more, the application of HTML and CSS have been really challenging thus far. It’s hard to build that solid foundation of knowledge into a skill that requires you to juggle so many things at once- structure, design, function, and UX all at the same time. Individually, the concept of them isn’t difficult at all and their syntax is actually very straight-forward- yet going from syntax and code to a product that people like and use is a leap in both skill and understanding that can’t be undertaken any way other than practice.</p>

<p>Since I like to have a foundation of knowledge first, skills that require big leaps of faith have always been a challenge for me. Without the confidence that my base is ready for stress, it’s difficult to begin taking steps that depend on such a shaky skill. I need time and practice to build my confidence which then fuels my foray into the intermediate skill level.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was raised to believe only in the growth mindset, and that is something that I’ve carried with me into adulthood. The energy you expend to become better pays off, and while direct cost-to-reward ratio certainly tapers off at some point, I do firmly believe that hard work is the only way to improve at anything, natural talent or not. Further, hard work is its own reward, and being able to take pride in the effort you expend to become great at something makes the greatness even sweeter.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to learning anything I can at DBC. I want to flip on every switch my brain has and just become a sponge for anything dev related- especially since I want to expand beyond web development into full stack web or even straight up infrastructure, I’ll need to quickly pick up skills that aren’t taught at DBC in order to find the job that is most satisfying. DBC is going to provide me with that beautiful foundation that I want, and then I’ll be ready to move beyond into the unknown realms of new languages, environments, and technologies.</p>
