<h1>Into a New Land</h1>

<h3>JavaScript, the Wilderness</h3>

<p>Several years ago, I first got the idea to learn web development from a friend and immediately dived into the CodeAcademy courses for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was challenging for me; with no technical background at all and rarely using computers for anything other than video games and music, I had very little framework on which to build my knowledge. I quickly abandoned the thought.</p>

<p>Now, after four weeks of truly shoveling as much Ruby down my throat, my brain is truly a different environment for learning JavaScript. Ruby has been a real pleasure to learn; lots of easy to understand resources, great community, and a slow slope moving from basic datatypes to constructing object-oriented programming projects. I've enjoyed it quite a bit, diving as heavy as my brain would allow into literature and as many resources as I could find.</p>

<p>Ruby was beginning to make sense. I was able to use it to create projects that I could grapple with and bring under my control. So far, JavaScript has afforded me little past frustration.</p>

<p>I know it's inevitable. Exiting my (tiny) comfort zone is scary, sure, but JavaScript is practically the soul of the web and anyone who seeks mastery in web development must tame the beast at some point. That said, I've found that there is so much in JavaScript that confuses me that I don't even know where to begin.</p>

<p>Objects in Ruby are controlled and declared through explicit, Object-specific keywords and syntax. First we code our class, then instantiate an object by sending the keyword message 'new' on the Class name. It's overt and apparent when an object is created and they work differently from standard Ruby methods.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, objects are declared using the keyword 'var', the same keyword used to declare a) variables, b) methods, and c) functions. Readability for object handling is reduced by this similar interface to instantiation, but what can be done?</p>

<p>One similarity between the two is that objects can hold both shape/form via their data (@instance variables in Ruby or attributes in JavaScript) as well as handle the receiving/sending of messages via methods (as far as I can tell, the only difference between a method and a function in JavaScript is that methods describe functions that are a part of an object's interface). This makes sense, though Javascript seems to lack overt/explicit handling of singleton methods.</p>

<p>One final difference that I'd like to bring up is inheritance. In any object-oriented language, inheritance can be very tricky, and alternative design solutions such as duck-typing can help resolve some of that trickiness. Ruby handles inheritance through single-parenting, as does JavaScript, though they describe them as 'parent' and 'prototype' respectively. Javascript allows for direct assigning of prototype descriptions for an object just like any other attribute; Ruby best practices generally have this information as a part of the class' base code (both for parent inheritance as well as Module mix-ins). Overall, it seems like JavaScript desires to eschew inheritance-based couplings for more modular objects.</p>

<p>My journey into the realm of JavaScript is just beginning, and I without a doubt miss my old homeland in Ruby. Since these are just my first two, it's easy to see any difference and immediately hate it, so I'll have to work extra hard to keep an open and positive mind towards my new friend in JavaScript.</p>
